# ParcelCraft (Cities: Skylines II)

**ParcelCraft is a foundational gameplay mod for Cities: Skylines II that introduces land ownership, acquisition, and hard land constraints as a core system.**

> You don’t build on land — you negotiate with it.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Cities: Skylines II currently allows:
- Free and infinite land usage
- Frictionless expansion
- Identical-looking cities across saves

ParcelCraft adds a missing gameplay layer where:
- Land has owners
- Expansion has cost and consequences
- Some land refuses development
- Cities grow with permanent constraints and identity

---

## Phase-1 Scope (Locked)

This project is intentionally **design-first and scope-locked**.

**Phase-1 includes:**
- Procedural land parcel generation at map start
- Multiple ownership types (government, private, agricultural, protected)
- Land acquisition methods (purchase, lease, eminent domain, PPP)
- Hard land restrictions (some parcels cannot be built on)
- Minimal, non-intrusive UI

**Phase-1 explicitly excludes:**
- Protest simulations
- Political systems
- Economy rebalancing
- Court or litigation mechanics

---

## Design Philosophy

- Performance-first
- No per-citizen simulation
- Event-based logic only
- Optional per save
- Designed to work with CS2 systems, not against them

---

## Project Status

This repository currently contains **design and planning only**.

Implementation will begin once a suitable technical partner joins the project.

## Looking For

I am looking for **one experienced Unity / C# modder familiar with CS2 modding** to collaborate as a technical partner.

This is not a request for free labor or ideas.
The core system design is already complete and scope is frozen.

If the concept interests you, feedback on technical feasibility is welcome.
