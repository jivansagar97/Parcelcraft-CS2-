# ParcelCraft — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the intended evolution of ParcelCraft.
Only Phase-1 is currently approved for implementation.

---

## Phase-1 (Current Focus — Locked)

- Land parcel generation
- Ownership types
- Acquisition mechanics
- Hard land restrictions
- Minimal UI / overlay

Goal: introduce land as a meaningful gameplay layer without performance impact.

---

## Phase-2 (Future — Not Started)

- Visual feedback for resistance
- Land value drift / speculation
- Advanced acquisition conditions
- Mega-project land handling

---

## Phase-3 (Conceptual)

- Private developer interaction
- Historical land claims
- Large infrastructure negotiation systems

---

## Important Note

Features listed beyond Phase-1 are **not commitments**.
They exist to guide long-term direction only.
